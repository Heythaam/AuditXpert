# Control and Audit Software

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a control and audit software using Qt in the C++ programming language. The software is designed to offer comprehensive control and audit capabilities, leveraging the power of the Qt framework to provide a robust and user-friendly solution.

## Achievements

### Development using Qt in C++

The software has been successfully developed using the Qt framework in the C++ programming language. This combination ensures a high level of performance and flexibility, allowing for efficient control and audit functionalities.

### Database Design Implementation

A meticulous database design has been implemented to precisely define the structure and relationships between entities. This ensures accurate data management and facilitates the seamless functioning of the control and audit processes.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To enhance user experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented. The GUI not only provides a visually appealing interface but also ensures that users can interact with the software in an intuitive and efficient manner.
